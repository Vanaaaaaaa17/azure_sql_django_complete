# Student Announcement: Week 2 Preparation

**Subject: Preparation for Week 2: Local Setup & Azure Deployment**

Hi everyone,

For our upcoming class (Week 2), we will be setting up the full stack (Frontend + Backend) locally and then **deploying everything to Azure**. Please complete the following steps **before** coming to class.

I have created a detailed guide here: [Student Preparation Guide (Week 2)](docs/STUDENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**Key Action Items:**

1.  **Install MongoDB & Compass:**
    *   We will be using a local MongoDB instance. Please install MongoDB Community Server and MongoDB Compass.
2.  **Install Node.js (v24 LTS):**
    *   This is required to run the frontend application.
3.  **Clone the Repositories:**
    *   Backend: `https://github.com/raksit/azure_sql_django_complete.git`
    *   Frontend: `https://github.com/raksit/azure_sql_django_frontend.git`
4.  **GitHub Setup:**
    *   Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
    *   **Important**: Fork both repositories to your own account so you can set up deployment pipelines later.
5.  **Azure Account:**
    *   Ensure you have an active **Azure for Students** subscription using your university email. We will be creating resources (SQL, Cosmos DB, App Service) in class.

If you encounter any issues during installation, please post in the class channel with a screenshot of the error.

See you in class!
